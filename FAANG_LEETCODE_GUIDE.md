# Staff+ FAANG LeetCode Study Guide

A curated, Staff+–level LeetCode problem list, organized week by week, mapped directly to the patterns and expectations of FAANG interviews in Java. This list is intentionally tight—every problem earns its place.

**You should not add extra problems unless you are consistently finishing early.**

## Target Cadence
- **~5 problems/week** (1 per day, 1 hr/day)
- **Rule:** If a problem takes >45 minutes, stop, review, and redo later.

## How to Review (Critical for Staff+)

After each week:

1. **Re-solve 1 failed problem without notes**
2. **Explain the solution out loud in under 3 minutes**
3. **Write down:**
   - Pattern
   - Key invariant
   - Common pitfall

---

## Additional Tips

- Focus on understanding the underlying patterns rather than memorizing solutions
- Practice explaining your thought process clearly and concisely
- Time yourself strictly - if you exceed 45 minutes, stop and review
- Prioritize quality over quantity
- Review weekly to reinforce learning and identify gaps
